This repository analyzes the MNX1-ETV6 fusion subtype in pAML using clinical cohorts from St. Jude, online TARGET data, PDX samples, cord blood laboratory, K562 cell lines, and mouse fetal liver stem cells. The analysis includes ChIP-seq, bulk RNA-seq, genomic fusion gene analysis (using the ARRIBA and STAR-fusion programs), and ATAC-seq. Tools such as Nextflow pipelines (nf-core) for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq were used, with results summarized using DiffBind, DeepTools, BEDOPS, ChIPseeker, HOMER, and other R/Bioconductor packages. The findings demonstrate that MNX1-ETV6 translation induces high MNX1 expression, and as a transcription factor, it drives a unique gene expression profile. Additionally, the analysis identifies a panel of upregulated surface proteins that could serve as potential treatment targets for CAR-T cell therapy.
